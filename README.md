## Data Set

The data was scraped from Craigslist on Friday, April 28th. It includes all room listings located in the East Bay. The dataset has columns for the listing's title, price, neighborhood, move-in date, room size, attributes, latitude, and longitude.

## Techniques

The first tab is a dot map that shows the specific locations of listings. You can filter according to price, size, and desired attributes. You can click on listings to get additional information.

The second tab is a choropleth map that shows the average room price for each region. You can click on regions to get additional information, aggregated by region.

The third tab is a small multiples plot that shows the percentage of listings that have certain attributes, broken up by neighborhood. You can select up to five neighorhoods to compare.

The fourth tab is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between room size and price. You can filter according to region and the neighorhoods in that region.  You can click on listings to get additional information.
